# what?

yup.

# but why? isnt that cheating? unfair?

well, i dont care anymore!<br>
no one can learn c++ in **2025** with _visual studio **6.0**_ on win xp!<br>
_especially_ when all the practices and the curriculum is outdated!<br>
i may rant more...

and no one wants to learn...

# why `<iostream.h>`? why `void main()`?

because if i write the "proper way", itd be clear who wrote the code (as if it isnt already) (inb4 this gets leaked big time)<br>
also makes the code smaller so its easier to copy to paper (yea, _**paper**_)

# why so much asking in the code?

how else am i/are we supposed to enter values in?<br>
these programs are supposed to work with arbitrary... values (even arrays.....), so `for` loops for **each item!**

# why do X instead of Y when Y is objectively better than X?

**because thats what we've been taught. i know it sucks but i cant rewrite the curriculum (yet)**

# i have no idea what is "NPUA"
# why are you so angry?
# what happened?

its okay. you dont need to know any of this. you can go now. maybe check some of our other repos
